# SHATTERED-Dev-2
This is the second upload of my indie game. (See first upload for compilation instructions)

# Changes
-Mostly the same things, except I added a menu you can access by following the directions in the next section. (You will not be able to close the window while you are in the menu)
<br />
-Added an animation for swinging your sword when facing forward and backward.

# Instructions
Move around with WASD. You will see an enemy that looks like you. To kill this enemy, face towards it while you are close to it (you'll have to be very close) and press the up arrow key to swing your sword. There will be no indicator that the enemy has been damaged, but in 10 hits it will dissappear. You can open the menu with M and close it with L. The menu will show you your inventory which you cannot edit or do anything to right now. The inventory currently consists of placeholder items (swords and bows) and none of these do anything.
